# A-Multilinear-Approach-to-Forecasting-ENSO
This repository contains scripts used in a study of the Subtropical Highs as predictors of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
Please contact me with any requests to modify the work under this repository for any publications. Not all scripts have been uploaded. 
Only programs relating to figure 3 in the pubication by the University of Chicago, titled "A Multilinear Approach to Forecasting the El 
Niño Southern Oscillation", are attached (A pdf version of this can also be found in the repository, titled "ENSO Paper - E=MC^2"). 
There are two folders in the repository, both containing the scripts required for testing the 
algorithm with various lead times. One folder contains "Live Scripts" (a feature in MATLAB), while the other contains the original 
scripts. Note that both types of scripts produce the same results but utilize different MATLAB features.
